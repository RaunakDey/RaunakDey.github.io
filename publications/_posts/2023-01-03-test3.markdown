Developed an optimization algorithm integrated with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tests for randomness suite to characterize how random are experimentally sampled tracjetories of Brownian particles. Our inverse model extracts real-random numbers from stochastic trajectories instead of algorithmitcally generated pseudo-randoms. Demonstrated on the experimentally measured trajectories of an optically trapped Brownian particle in water.
