                    My area of expertise is in Physics and Deep Learning. I study complex systems using the methods dynamical systems, controls & optimization. These quantitative
                    methods are broadly applicable to different types of complex systems in Biology, Data Science, Physics and Finance. Here are a few topics I have focused on in recent years:<br>

                    1. <strong> Inference in virus-microbe networks:</strong> In Nature, multiple species on viruses and their microbial hosts can coexist together completely or partially. To understand human health
                     or environmental outcomes of these complex networks, it is necessary to have a physical model, infer who interacts with whom and infer their life-history traits. I focus on building inverse
                     models on population time series datasets of such models using Bayesian approaches. When antibiotics, phage-cocktails and multiple strains of microbes are present together, I try
                     to address what would be the optimal course of such treatments using an inverse model. Further, in natural or lab experiments, I try to understand how emergent effects and higher order
                     interactions can affect community outcomes. I employ a range of techniques, such as multimodal machine learning, network theory, MCMC approaches to understand these application-driven
                     complex virus-microbe infection networks and microbe-microbe interaction networks. <br>

                    2. <strong>Probabilistic ML:</strong> In inverse models, only inferring the parameters can provide partial representation. 
                     I try to focus on latent space engineering, that reduces a probabilistic programming in lower dimension to a deterministic
                     program in higher dimension by engineering appropriate learnable latent space representation. I use such techniques,
                     to create ODE analogs of Bayesian virus-microbe models with hyperpriors, model heterogeneity of population data, model 
                     hidden latent variables for causal infernece.

                    3. <strong>LLM and time series:</strong> The strong inductive bias of LLMs can be leveraged to forecast time series in an autoregressive
                     matter through intelligent prompt engineering or tokenziation schemes. However the biggest challenges are limitations of context windows,
                     lack of explanable features, subpar performances of real dynamical systems. I try to integrate Physics approaches to such LLM driven time series
                     forecasting problems to understand the granular features of these emerging LLMs forecasters.<br>

                 <p style="text-align:justify">
                    3. <strong>Stochastic time series:</strong> I worked extensively on stochastic time series coming from Brownian probes. I developed an iterative algorithm to study the randomness in those trajectories. 
                    The ML algorithm featured with NIST tests for randomness extracts best possible "true random numbers", unlike computer generated "pseudo-random numbers". <br>

                 <p style="text-align:justify">
                    4. <strong>Control and optmization: </strong> I developed an online feedback-control algorithm
                    to maximise the Signal to Noise radio while performing broadband microrheology measurement on these stochastic probes. We improved the SNR 10x on a 10^3 Hz bandwidth. We used our method to study viscoelasticity of Lamin proteins. <br>
