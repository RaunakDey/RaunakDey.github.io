            I am a fourth year Physics PhD student at the <a href="https://weitzgroup.umd.edu">Quantitative Viral Dynamics<a> group at the <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu">University of Maryland</a>, College Park.
            I am advised by <a href="https://biology.umd.edu/people/dr-joshua-weitz">Prof. Joshua Weitz</a> and <a href="https://sjbeckett.github.io">Dr. Stephen Beckett</a>.   
            My research is highly interdisciplinary and covers the broad area of Physics and Deep Learning based inverse modeling for dynamical systems. Particularly, my PhD thesis is focused on
            building inverse models on multiple bacteriophages infecting multiple microbes, inferring their functional traits and network connections from polulation time-series data.

            I started my Physics PhD at <a href="https://physics.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> in the Fall of 2021, where I earned a second <a ref="https://www.parchment.com/u/award/d54fad6b9380df07cc48c245212a81bc"MS in Physics</a> before transitioning to the University of Maryland, College Park in the Fall of 2023. Previously, I obtained a BS-MS dual degree in Physics from <a href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata</a>, where I worked at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/iiserkol.ac.in/light-matter-lab-iiserk/home?authuser=0">Light-Matter lab</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iiserkol.ac.in/light-matter-lab-iiserk/Group-Leader/group-leader?authuser=0">Prof. Ayan Banerjee</a>. My MS thesis was on building instrumentation and algorithms to study the  stochastic motion of brownian particles in viscoelastic fluids using optical tweezers. Also, I have interned with <a href="https://lilab.ok.ubc.ca/index.html">Dr. Isaac Li</a>, at the <a href="https://ok.ubc.ca"> University of British Columbia</a>, Canada, building a computer vision enabled remote control optical tweezers systems. I have worked with <a href="https://silvascience.org/chair/">Prof. Carlos Silva</a>, at Georgia Tech on building two-photon spectroscopy setups. I was a visiting scholar at <a href="https://www.ncra.org"> National Center for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA)</a> where I worked with <a href="http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/people/Academic_FacultyPage?oid=249">Prof. Yashwant Gupta</a> on automated noise detection pipelines for pulsar observations.
