            I am a fourth-year Physics Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu">Department of Physics at the University of Maryland</a>, College Park.
            I am advised by <a href="https://biology.umd.edu/people/dr-joshua-weitz">Prof. Joshua Weitz</a> and mentored by <a href="https://sjbeckett.github.io">Dr. Stephen Beckett</a>.   
            My research focuses on solving inverse problems using time series data. Given data points ordered in time, I aim to develop interpretable models and algorithms to infer the underlying phenomena governing the dynamics of the system. To
            do so, I employ several tools from Bayesian inference, control theory, and optimization.
            
            
            <!-- My research is highly interdisciplinary, covering the broad areas of Physics and Deep Learning based-inverse modeling for dynamical systems. My Ph.D. thesis is focused on building interpretable mechanistic inverse models for 
            for phage infections of bacteria in a community and inferring their functional traits and network interactions from population time-series data. I also design optimal treatment for infection with control theory and Bayesian inference.
            This year, I was awarded the <a href="https://www.umdphysics.umd.edu/about-us/awards-2.html#thomas-g-mason-interdisciplinary-physics-fellowship">Thomas G. Mason Interdisciplinary Physics Fund</a> 
                and the <a href="https://microbiome.umd.edu/team/2024-summer-interns/">UMD Microbiome Award</a>; previously, I was a Mitacs research fellow (Canada) and an Inspire fellow (India).

        <p class="text-justify">
            My research is highly interdisciplinary, at the intersection of Physics, Machine Learning, and Biology. I have extensive professional experience in handling large datasets, developing end-to-end hardware and software pipelines for precision instrumentation, and industrial experience in managing a professional team. 
            Some of my projects include: developing pharmacological inverse models for phage therapy from multimodal datasets, inventing control algorithms for Optical Tweezers-based precision microrheology,
            creating constrained optimizers for network inference from time-series data, and devising machine learning pipelines for automated noise detection and removal in radio astronomy time series.

            I began my Physics PhD at <a href="https://physics.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> in Fall 2021,
            where I earned a second <a ref="https://www.parchment.com/u/award/d54fad6b9380df07cc48c245212a81bc">MS in Physics</a> before transitioning to the University of Maryland, College Park in Fall 2023.
            Before that, I obtained a BS-MS dual degree in Physics from the <a href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata</a>,
            where I worked in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/iiserkol.ac.in/light-matter-lab-iiserk/home?authuser=0">Light-Matter lab</a> 
            with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iiserkol.ac.in/light-matter-lab-iiserk/Group-Leader/group-leader?authuser=0">Prof. Ayan Banerjee</a>. 
             My MS thesis involved building instrumentation and algorithms to study the stochastic motion of Brownian particles in viscoelastic fluids using optical tweezers.  
            I interned with <a href="https://lilab.ok.ubc.ca/index.html">Prof. Isaac Li</a> at the <a href="https://ok.ubc.ca"> University of British Columbia</a>, Canada 
            developing a computer vision-enabled remote control optical tweezers system. I also worked with <a href="https://silvascience.org/chair/">Prof. Carlos Silva</a>
            at Georgia Tech on constructing two-photon spectroscopy setups. Additionally, I was a visiting scholar at the <a href="https://www.ncra.org"> National Center for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA)</a> 
            where I worked with <a href="http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/people/Academic_FacultyPage?oid=249">Prof. Yashwant Gupta</a> 
            on automated noise detection and removal pipelines for pulsar observations.
